# hello-world
I'm totally new to this world, I'm a web designer and I'd like to learn more about the programming world, that's why I decided to join this community. I hope I'll be able to learn some cool things from some smart people. Cheers!
OK, so GitHub told me to write something about me. I'm a young web developer/designer full of hopes and dreams who's trying to acomplish her lifelong dream of becomeing something more than "just a girl who should be in the kitchen", or more than a librarian (I'm studying to be one, yeah, yay me). I love programming, I learned a bit about it in highschool and it was awesome but at the time I was too lazy to dive into it. Now, a couple years later, I realized that I really like programming and I would like to know more about it. And this is the story how I applied to a course for web design and why I'm actually here.
